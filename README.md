# Prescribing duration

This is a project investigating the duration of prescriptions for long-term conditions (LTCs).

This analysis used our template for reproducible, cross-platform
analysis in a Jupyter notebook, using Docker. 

## How to view the notebooks

Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder (with an `ipynb`
extension). You can most easily view them [on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ebmdatalab/seb-docker-test/tree/master/notebooks/),
though looking at them in Github should also work.

To do development work, you'll need to set up a local jupyter server
and git repository - see `DEVELOPERS.md` for more detail.
